instructions = "Welcome to chromatopy. When prompted, provide a filepath to your data (.csv output from openchrom). Select the peaks of interest from the first sample. Chromatopy will then automatically select peaks in subsequent samples. After each sample, results and figures are saved to a subfolder created in the user-provided data directory. Chromatopy will export a .csv file containing peak areas. To calculate relative abundances and common indices, run chromatopy.assign_indices(). \nFeel free to end an integration session by terminating the kernel as your resutls will not be deleted. You can revisit samples at any time. To redo a sample, delete the row containing the integration data from the results.csv output.\n1. Left click peaks for integration.\n2. 'd' to delete the last peak selected.\n3. 'r' to clear selected peaks from a subplot (navigate subplots using up and down arrow keys).\n 4. 'Enter' once peak selection is satisfied.\n"
